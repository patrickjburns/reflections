Viewing th diff between two versions helps to isolate and pintpoint where a difference may be.
Seeing the code in sections also helped to break down and view the differences.
Having a longterm history will find previous versions of the file. That way I can see how it was in the past

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
 Pros: control over committs
 Cons: have to do it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Because the files are inter-related

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 Use git log to find all commits, git diff to see the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	Because I know we could come back to them
